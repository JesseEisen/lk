### An Essay on Man

<q>All nature is but art, unknown to thee;
All chance, direction, which thou canst not see;
All discord, harmony not understood;
All partial evil, universal good.
And, spite of pride, in erring reason's spite,
One truth is clear, 'Whatever is, is right.' </q>
##### Alexander Pope, An Essay on Man

<q>Stop buying the unnecessary,  <br />
stop doing the non-essential.</q>
